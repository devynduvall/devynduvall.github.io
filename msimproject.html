            <h3>Project Description</h3>
            <p>
                During my time completing a Masters degree in Information Management at The University of Washingtons iSchool, I worked with the schools Admissions Board to investigate the factors that led to students registering for the Master of Science in Information Management upon acceptance.
            </p>
            <p>
                In undertaking this inquiry, I deployed admissions, demographics, and previous education datasets. I further analyzed the competitor landscape to give insight into the Information Schools at relevant insitutions. My comprehensive report of competitors included the types of programs provided, the technical level of their curricula, the availability of internships and other experiential learning opportunities, and the job prospects and salaries for graduates.
            </p>
            <h3>Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                I deployed machine learning and statistical analysis to indentify the factors that made students more likely to register for their first quarter of class in the MSIM program. After testing different classification models, I found that the data best fit a simple Logistic Regression model, which I then used to determine relevant factors. For this work, the Logistic Regression allowed me to assess feature importance, as the values of the coefficients give an idea of feature importance.
            </p>

            <p>
                To determine differences between other schools, I created a feature table, which simplifies the process of comparing and evaluating competing products or services based on predefined criteria. In the case of the UW iSchool, a feature table is used to compare the offerings of the iSchool with those of other similar programs.

            <h3>Outcomes</h3>
            <p>
                My research identified three factors from the Logistic Regression coefficients, which were confirmed by the feature table of other institutions' advantages; These factors included the increased technicality of the coursework and the need to market to students outside of Washington State. 
            </p>
            <h3>Next Steps</h3>
            <p>
                The subsequent iterations of this project will work to corroborate the above factors through exit surveys to prospective students who decline their admission offers. Given the data and resources to continue, this work would undertake further analysis of the competition and create an operational dashboard to report real-time data for wide-reaching visibility.
