            <h3>Project Description</h3>
            <p>
                I lead a cross-functional project with Sales, Customer Success, and Support teams within CentralSquare to develop a predictive tool for customer churn powered by machine learning. To understand the organization's needs, I led Customer Success Management (CSM) interviews to fully comprehend the datasets I obtained and contextualize my data management and reporting.
            </p>

            <h3>Initial Findings</h3>
            <p>
                In my initial CSM interviews, it became clear that the working procedure for predicting customer churn was based solely on impressions and subjective reporting. CSMs wanted a solution to streamline planning and determine which customers were the most at risk.
            </p>

            <p>
                My initial machine-learning solution used a Logistic Regression model to depict trends. After developing this first iteration, I brought my findings to key organizational stakeholders, including the Director of Customer Success and Product Support. In this presentation, I conveyed my results at a high level, helping stakeholders understand how the tool could be used and the benefits of using this methodology for sales, CSMs, and support teams.

            <h3>Outcomes</h3>

            <p>
                The initial model showed an 88% accuracy rate with simple feature selection and data cleaning, which would undoubtedly be improved upon with further resources devoted to its development â€“ which have not yet been allocated by the organization.
            </p>
            <p>
                Already, this work has led to the further development of supporting procedures. I created a plan to develop data integrity checks to ensure data parity, aiding in model predictions and training. Data integrity enables real-time reporting and understanding of which customers are about to churn from the organization.
            </p>

            <p>
                To enable rapid reporting and visibility across the organization, I created a dashboard to give CSMs the desired visibility and tooling. This tool allows CSMs to plan their accounts based on the model and the prediction probability for the likelihood of a client churning to other organizations.

                The dashboard above has been anonymized.
            </p>
            <h3>Next Steps</h3>
            <p>
                While presenting my work to key stakeholders, I gained further context on what adjustments and future developments would benefit CSMs. While I've been able to begin these changes, a full-time data scientist position devoted to this tool would be needed to continue model training and hyperparameter tuning to increase the accuracy level and improve the tool.
